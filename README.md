Just walked out of Death of a Unicorn and I can't even. Seriously. First off, why is this movie even called that? I mean, sure, there’s a unicorn, and it’s not exactly having a good day, but “Death of a Unicorn” sounds like it’s supposed to be some kind of legendary emo rock album from 2007. Who comes up with these things? 

So, this movie. I was expecting rainbows, sparkling nonsense, maybe some glitter—something! But instead, it was like, Hey, we’re gonna lure you in with a unicorn and then serve you existential crisis pie with a side of melancholy sauce. Was there even a moral or lesson? I couldn't figure it out under all the layers of Wow, life is b𝘭𝘦𝘢𝘬. Maybe they should’ve handed out instruction manuals along with popcorn.

There was this one scene... I swear, it hit like a rogue avalanche. The setting was like something out of a watercolor fever dream, jagged rock formations against a sky on fire, and I was honestly just waiting for a geology lesson to start. And can we talk about how the characters just wandered around with these expressions like they’d lost all their spare socks? Just completely dumbfounded. Maybe life is about hunting for metaphoric socks. That’s deep. Or just confusing. Probably confusing.

> And what was with that soundtrack? It was like someone recorded their dishwasher running and said, “This is abstract art, okay?” Not to say it was all bad, but it made me feel like I was trapped in a surrealist painting, trying to find the exit. Or the plot.

A lecturer’s rambling about sedimentary rocks would have had more structure than this narrative did. But, in its defense, the absurdity kind of pulls you in before you know it. Like quicksand made of rainbow jelly. One minute you're critiquing, the next you're emotionally compromised thinking about childhood dreams and...I don't know, the meaning of life? I’ve never needed a drink and a nap in equal measures so badly after a movie.

public void Overthink()
{
    if (feels == all over the place)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(Welcome to existential land.);
    }
}

So, should you 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the movie? Well, if you’re up for a mental quest that feels like an unsupervised rollercoaster ride, go for it. 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it and maybe, just maybe, you'll emerge on the other side with a different perspective on granola bars—or life. Not that I’d know. 

In the end, my brain feels like a rock tumbler turned on full blast, smoothing out the jagged impressions into something comprehensible. Maybe. I’m gonna go sit quietly by some rocks and ponder if unicorns are just the friends we lost along the way.
